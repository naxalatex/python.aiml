# python.aiml

A small collection of Python examples, reference scripts, and Jupyter notebooks focused on basic programming concepts and introductory AI/ML-related examples. This repository is organized for learning and experimenting with Python language features, OOP concepts, and simple data/array operations.

## Repository structure

- `python/` — main working folder containing reference scripts and notebooks
	- `reference/` — individual example scripts and notebooks
		- `c.py`, `classs.py`, `inheritance.py`, `polymorphismm.py`, `data analyst.py`, `data analyst.ipynb`, `numpy.ipynb`, etc.
	- `__pycache__/` — compiled bytecode (auto-generated)

## Goals

- Provide short, self-contained Python examples demonstrating OOP, numerical operations, and small data-analytic snippets.
- Host accompanying Jupyter notebooks for interactive exploration.

## Quickstart (Windows PowerShell)

Prerequisites:

- Python 3.8+ installed and available on PATH
- (Optional) Jupyter installed to run notebooks

Recommended setup (PowerShell):

```powershell
# create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1

# install commonly useful packages (optional)
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install jupyter numpy pandas
```

Notes:
- If PowerShell blocks Activate.ps1, run `Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned` as Administrator or use the `Activate.bat` in cmd.exe.
- Some filenames in `reference/` include spaces (for example `data analyst.py`). To run them from PowerShell, wrap the path in quotes.

## Running example scripts

From the repository root, you can run any example script with Python. Examples below assume you're in `d:\aiml`.

```powershell
# Run a simple script
python .\python\reference\inheritance.py

# If filename contains spaces
python ".\python\reference\data analyst.py"
```

## Working with Jupyter notebooks

Start Jupyter Notebook or Lab to open and run the `.ipynb` files inside `python/reference`:

```powershell
jupyter notebook
# or
jupyter lab
```

## Suggested small improvements (optional)

- Rename files to remove spaces (e.g., `data_analyst.py`) for easier command-line usage.
- Add a `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml` if the project depends on specific packages.
- Add short README headers for each major script explaining its purpose.

## Contributing

Small contributions are welcome. Good first steps:

- Open an issue explaining the change or bug.
- Send a pull request with a clear description and change summary.

## License

Add a license file (for example `LICENSE`) to make the project's licensing explicit. If you don't add one, the repository defaults to "All rights reserved".

## Contact

If you want help shaping the README or adding examples, tell me which scripts/notebooks you want documented and I can update this README or create individual READMEs per folder.

Generated: concise README tailored for this workspace. Ask me to expand any section or to commit a `requirements.txt` and per-file descriptions.
